# Eiffel Broadcaster Plugin

This Jenkins plugin sends Eiffel events to a Message Queue. For now, only RabbitMQ is supported.
The plugin can be extended with more events and or more data but the required data is there.
A detailed list of event representations can be found in the table below.

Read more about the Eiffel protocol on https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel

| Job Dequeued (canceled)     | EiffelActivityCanceledEvent  |
