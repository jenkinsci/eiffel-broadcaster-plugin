# Eiffel Broadcaster Plugin

This Jenkins plugin sends Eiffel events to a Message Queue. For now, only RabbitMQ is supported.
The plugin can be extended with more events and or more data but the required data is there.
A detailed list of event representations can be found in the table below.

Read more about the Eiffel protocol at https://eiffel-community.github.io/.
The plugin and its features were presented at the 2021 Eiffel Summit;
the [presentation slides](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/presentations/eiffel_summit_2021.1/The%20eiffel-broadcaster%20Jenkins%20plugin.pdf)
and a [video](https://youtu.be/fRCq9VosRJA) are available.

## Jenkins events represented in Eiffel

A number of Jenkins events automatically result in Eiffel events.
Additionally, builds have various options of emitting events of their own.

| Jenkins Event           | Eiffel Event                 |
| ------------------------|------------------------------|
| Job Queued              | [EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md) |
| Job Dequeued (canceled) | [EiffelActivityCanceledEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityCanceledEvent.md) |
| Job Starts              | [EiffelActivityStartedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityStartedEvent.md) |
| Job Finishes            | [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md) |
| Job Successful          | [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md) |
| Job Unstable            | [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md) |
| Job Failed              | [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md) |
| Job Aborted             | [EiffelActivityFinishedEvent](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityFinishedEvent.md) |

The plugin conforms to the
[Paris edition](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases/tag/edition-paris)
of the Eiffel protocol for the events it emits. Users of the provided
sendEiffelEvent pipeline step may choose to emit events from any Eiffel
edition up to and including the
[Orizaba edition](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases/tag/edition-orizaba).
See the documentation of each event for details of the corresponding event version used.

## Accessing emitted Eiffel events in builds
If a build needs to emit Eiffel events of its own they should probably have
a CONTEXT or CAUSE link to the build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent. The
plugins injects the following environment variables with the contents of
the previously sent events:
* `EIFFEL_ACTIVITY_TRIGGERED`: The build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent event.
* `EIFFEL_ACTIVITY_STARTED`: The build's EiffelActivityStartedEvent event.

## Category configuration

The contents of the `data.categories` member in EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent
is configurable in two ways:

* A global plugin setting.
* A setting in each job, configured via the UI or the `eiffelActivity` pipeline
  property:
```
properties([
    eiffelActivity(categories: ['jenkins', 'maven'])
])
```

Categories can e.g. be used to distinguish Eiffel activities that represent
Jenkins builds from other kinds of activities, or distinguish between
different kinds of Jenkins builds.

Globally configured categories will be merged with the categories specified
in each job. Duplicate entries will be eliminated.

## Pipeline steps

### buildWithEiffel

The buildWithEiffel pipeline step is an extension of [BuildTriggerStep](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-build-step-plugin/blob/491.v1fec530da_858/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/support/steps/build/BuildTriggerStep.java)
from [pipeline-build-step-plugin 491.v1fec530da_858](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-build-step-plugin/tree/491.v1fec530da_858) that can override event data in the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent (ActT) that is sent when the triggered downstream build enters the
build queue. Currently, `data.name` can be overridden.

In addition to the parameters in the base step (see [Pipeline: Build step](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-build-step/releases/#version_491.v1fec530da_858))
it accepts the following parameters:

| Argument     | Required | Description                                      |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| activityName |          | The Eiffel activity name of the triggered build. |

Example:
```
buildWithEiffel job: "foo/bar", propagate: false, waitForStart: true, activityName: "activity_name" 
```

### createPackageURL

The createPackageURL pipeline step accepts individual components of a
[Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) and returns a properly
formatted and quoted string that e.g. can be used when piecing together an
EiffelArtifactedCreatedEvent. See the Package URL specification for details on
what the components mean.

| Argument    | Required | Description               |
| ------------|----------|---------------------------|
| type        | ✔        | The package "type" or package "protocol" such as maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. |
| namespace   |          | A name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. |
| name        | ✔        | The name of the package. |
| version     |          | The version of the package. |
| qualifiers  |          | A Groovy map with extra qualifying data for a package such as an OS, architecture, a distro, etc. |
| subpath     |          | Extra subpath within a package, relative to the package root. |

Example:
```
def purl = createPackageURL type: 'generic', namespace: 'name/space',
    name: 'pkgname', version: '1.0', subpath: 'some/path', qualifiers: [a: 'b']
echo "Here's the resulting purl: ${purl}"
```

### publishEiffelArtifacts

The publishEiffelArtifacts pipeline step sends an EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent
for each EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent that has been recorded in the build using
a sendEiffelEvent step with the `publishArtifact` argument enabled and for
each artifact recorded in the specified JSON files in the workspace.

This requires that each EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent has at least one file
defined in its `data.fileInformation` array and that each relative file path
in `data.fileInformation.name` matches a Jenkins artifact in the build.
Because of the latter requirement it's normally used after an
[archiveArtifacts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/core/#code-archiveartifacts-code-archive-the-artifacts)
step.

The EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent will have two links; one ARTIFACT link to
the EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent and one CONTEXT link to the parent build's
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.

| Argument            | Required | Description               |
| --------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| artifactEventFiles  |          | An Ant-style glob expression that selects files containing JSON representations (one per line) of EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent to publish. |

Example of publishing artifacts connected to the build:
```
def event = [
    'meta': [
        'type': 'EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent',
        'version': '3.0.0',
    ],
    'data': [
        'identity': 'pkg:generic/myprogram@1.0',
        'fileInformation': [
            [
                'name': 'myprogram-1.0.tar.gz',
            ],
        ],
    ],
]
sendEiffelEvent event: event, publishArtifact: true

archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'myprogram-1.0.tar.gz'
publishEiffelArtifacts()
```

Example of publishing artifacts from a file:
```
def event = [
    'meta': [
        'type': 'EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent',
        'version': '3.0.0',
    ],
    'data': [
        'identity': 'pkg:generic/myprogram@1.0',
        'fileInformation': [
            [
                'name': 'myprogram-1.0.tar.gz',
            ],
        ],
    ],
]
writeJSON file: 'events.json', json: event

archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'myprogram-1.0.tar.gz'
publishEiffelArtifacts artifactEventFiles: '*.json'
```

### sendEiffelEvent

The sendEiffelEvent pipeline step sends an Eiffel event from that's built in
the Groovy code or read into a Groovy map from another location. It accepts
the following parameters:

| Argument               | Required                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| event                  | ✔                                | A map with the event payload. The `meta.id` and `meta.time` members will be populated automatically.                                                                                                                                    |
| linkToActivity         |                                  | If true (default) the event sent will automatically include link to the current build's EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.                                                                                                                   |
| activityLinkType       |                                  | The link type to use when linking to the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent. Defaults to CONTEXT but can be set to CAUSE.                                                                                                                     |
| publishArtifact        |                                  | If true and the event being sent is EiffelArtifactCreatedEvent it will be recorded for possible later use by the publishEiffelArtifacts step.                                                                                           |
| signatureCredentialsId |                                  | The id of the credentials containing the private key to use when signing. Set to an empty string (default) if the event shouldn't be signed.                                                                                            |
| signatureHashAlgorithm | If signatureCredentialsId is set | The name of the hash algorithm to use when signing. Must match the key algorithm; see the table in [§3.1 of RFC 7518](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.1). Valid values are "SHA-256", "SHA-384", and "SHA-512". |

Example:
```
def event = [
    "meta": [
        "type": "EiffelCompositionDefinedEvent",
        "version": "3.0.0",
    ],
    "data": [
        "name": "my-composition",
    ],
]
def sent = sendEiffelEvent event: event
echo "This event was sent: ${sent}"
echo "The event had the id ${sent.meta.id}"

// Make the activity link a CAUSE link
sendEiffelEvent event: event, activityLinkType: "CAUSE"

// Skip the activity link altogether
sendEiffelEvent event: event, linkToActivity: false

// Sign the event using the "event-signing" credentials, containing an ECDSA P-521 key.
sendEiffelEvent event: event, linkToActivity: false, signatureCredentialsId: "event-signing", signatureHashAlgorithm: "SHA-512"
```

This step returns immediately as soon as the event has been validated and put
in the internal outbound queue. The actual delivery of the event to the broker
might not have happened at the time of the return. The step's return value is
the event that was enqueued, expressed as a map (see example above).

The validation supports all events and event versions up to and including the
[Orizaba edition](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases/tag/edition-orizaba).

## API
The plugin will do its best to populate the emitted
EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent with information taken from the causes of
the build, but in many cases you'll want to inject additional Eiffel links
that the plugin can't figure out on its own. This can be done with the
$JOB_URL/eiffel/build API endpoint which works nearly identially to the
standard $JOB_URL/build endpoint except that it requires an additional
`eiffellinks` form parameter that contains the Eiffel links to include in
the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent. `eiffellinks` follows the same schema
as the `links` value in Eiffel events. Example (payload lacking URL
encoding to improve readability):
```
POST $JOB_URL/eiffel/build
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

json={"eiffellinks": [{"target": "662b3813-bef4-4588-bf75-ffaead24a6d5", "type": "CAUSE"}], "parameter": [{"name": "PARAM_NAME", "value": "param value"}]}
```
The `eiffellinks` key is mandatory for this endpoint but `parameter` is
optional. If the latter is omitted and the job is parameterized the default
values for all parameters will be used.

If at least one CAUSE link is included in `eiffellinks`, an `EIFFEL_EVENT`
trigger will be included in the EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.

## Event signing

The plugin supports signing of event payloads according to the [Eiffel
protocol's signing specification](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-syntax-and-usage/security.md).
Events are signed with the private key from certificates stored in
PKCS #12 files, uploaded to certificate credentials in Jenkins.
It's fine if the certificate is self-signed; the certificate chain
isn't verified and only the subject name is used (for the
`meta.security.authorIdentity` member).

For signing purposes, events come in two forms:

- System events, i.e. events sent by the plugin itself. This includes
activity events and the EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent sent as a result
of the publishEiffelArtifacts pipeline step. These events are signed
with a private key stored in a system certificate credential that's
only accessible to administrators. After creating the credential,
select it in the _Certificate to use for signing of system events_
dropdown in the plugin configuration (visible when _Enable signing of
system events_ is checked).
- User events, i.e. events whose contents are materially influenced
by a user. This currently applies to events sent by the sendEiffelEvent
step. These events are signed with the private key from a credential
added to a folder accessible to the build.

### Certificate creation

Here's an example of how to create an ECDSA P-521 keypair and convert it
to the PKCS #12 format expected by the
[Credentials plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/):

```
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out system-signing.priv.pem
openssl req -new -x509 -key system-signing.priv.pem -out system-signing.cert.pem -subj /CN=some-identifier -days 365
openssl x509 -noout -text -in system-signing.cert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey system-signing.priv.pem -in system-signing.cert.pem -out system-signing.pfx
```

The `-subj` flag to `openssl req` specifies the subject of the certificate
and can be any distinguished name that makes sense to you. If you omit that
flag you'll be prompted for the values that can make up a distinguished name.
The subject is what's going to be displayed in the Jenkins interface when
certificate credentials are listed.

The `openssl pkcs12` command will prompt you for a password. You can choose
any password you like, just make sure that you'll be able to input the same
password when the resulting file is uploaded to Jenkins.

## How to build and install this plugin from source
