    If enabled, the outbound events sent by the plugin itself will be signed.
    This includes the activity events like
    <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent.md">
        EiffelActivityTriggeredEvent
    </a> but also
    <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/blob/master/eiffel-vocabulary/EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent.md">
        EiffelArtifactPublishedEvent
    </a> sent by the <tt>publishEiffelArtifacts</tt> pipeline step. Specifically,
    events that are largely under the control of end users will not be signed.
